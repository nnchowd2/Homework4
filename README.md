# Homework4

Assignment 4 consists of LAB exercises from chapters 12 and 14. Chapter 12 covers exceptions and explains errors, raising exceptions, the use of try and except, and finally for clean ups. Chapter 14 covers searching and sorting algorithms through different kinds of funtions. 

LAB 12.7 This code calculates an adult's fat-burning heart rate based on their age as an input. The code implements try and except and outputs errors for incorrect inputs. In this case the age must not be below 18 or over 75, otherwise the code would return an error and output that it failed to calculate the result.

LAB 12.9 This exercise reads single word names and ages and outputs the list with incremented ages. The code makes sure that the first index of the list is a single word and the second is an age number, in order to perform the calculation. Otherwise it implements rule of exceptions to return the input with age=0.

14.11 This code sorts a list of integers in a descending order and outputs the sorted list after each iteration. It implements a sorting algorithm called selection sort and passes it as a function to perform the iterations.  

14.13 The last excercise uses the functions quicksort and partition to sort the list of input IDs in ascending order and calculates the number of times the quicksort() function was called by incrementing a global value. This code implements quicksort algorithm by taking the middle item as the pivot to repeatedly partition the input into low and high parts to sort the input.
